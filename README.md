## Research interests
My research covers two main themes: inference of patterns that drive behaviour, and physical constraints on inference. I study both of these through a combination of statistical physics, Bayesian inference, and information theory. 

I'm currently interested in feeding behaviour as a prototype for more complex motivated behaviours - it's a fundamental behaviour which is shared across species, but is rich enough to include aspects of reward, learning, and planning. With mice we also have good _in vivo_ access to measure and control the neural populations underlying feeding ([review](http://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(15)00617-8)), so we can expect a better back-and-forth between experimental and theoretical studies than is possible with complex human behaviours we might eventually want to understand.
